Here are some examples:

  * Copy a spreadsheet and change the clipboard so that it can be pasted into a wiki, with vertical bars (|) instead of tabs
  * Modify your multi-line clipboard text so that it can be pasted into Java or Python.
  * Modify an URL in the clipboard pointing to Amazon so that it has your Associate ID in it.
  * Decompose an URL so that it can be parsed by humans, or Python.
  * Run your clipboard through an arbitrary program (like sort) via piping.
  * Force the multi clipboard into text only.
  * Convert some text into unicode with \unnnn type escapes.
  * Print out a variable in python.

It uses wxPython and if you bring it's window to the front your clipboard will be modified according to which modifier is currently selected.
