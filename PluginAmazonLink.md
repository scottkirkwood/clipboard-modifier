# Introduction #

Navigate to an Amazon page like
```
http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0201485419/ref=s9_asin_image_2-hf_favarpcbss_2238_p/102-1722741-9600945?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I1B1K3406DXXD8&colid=3TDODZYOX7Y6Z&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=07G7DSC9Q3E0C50S0FQM&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=279438701&pf_rd_i=507846
```
and then copy the URL, go to the clipboard modifier and you'll get this
```
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485419/?tag=softwareforusers
```
Which is not only shorter but has my Amazon Associate id inside.

The URL that I make is a little bit old school.  Amazon has newer style links which I'm not too fond of.

Method to put your Associate ID without messing with the code. **Done!**
