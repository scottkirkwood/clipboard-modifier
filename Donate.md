# Introduction #

I do these projects in my spare time for fun.
But if you'd like to recognize my contribution try using flattr.

# Flattr #

[Flattr](http://flattr.com/) is a social micropayment platform. Help support the people you like - and enable them to continue to do what they do! And add your own things to Flattr and receive support from others.  With your donations I'll be able to flattr other people I think are doing good work.
